  // should be connecting pivot points, circles at the ends of a rectangle. Overlap the centers. Define this
  // shape. If complexity is used that should be a lowerbound for turn points in case extras are needed
  // to connect the last smooth rectangle with the starting one. Finish line should be the center of the
  // rectangle. You can preset it during the tests.
